# Multiplayer card game

Early prototype for a multiplayer cards game where player battle a common enemy together.

Developed using Unity.

The networking part is done using c#'s networking library, sending packets over TCP.

Not sure how much is working on the depot, have not tried to run the game in quite some time.
